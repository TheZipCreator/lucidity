Tylor's footnotes
for lucidity have the player find things that are not in the game yet and cant be gathered any other way unless they are found
have a patch notes section in the menu that shows upcoming features and some of the features that are not supposed to be in the game can be found half finished in the game example finding food from mobs that arnt in the game. add a patch note the says fixed player spawning in ground to add to the unreliableness of the patch notes. also have patch notes say farming has been added but farming is not possible
things to add that are not finished on purpose for this: tires, block of redstone, iron doors but no way to open them yet, book shelves (no books and when broken drop texture errors), trough, 
top left says the version number: unreliable
add blocks that are nammed after the theme of the game also add blocks in the sky that randomly appear one of the blocks that can appear will have almost the same color as the sky and be hard to spot
wakestone could be what the player character is trying to work twords it can be one of the "glitches" of the world and if we have a few more glitch blocks then they can make something with them still dont know what it will do but its a goal to work twords for the character have a couple ideas to run by the other creator and we will see what sticks
so there will be a machine in the dream world that you can put the mateirals in and it will stop the weirdness for a while then accelerate it breaking the machine will kill you and put you in a coma forever the main point is you being in the game is the reason the glitches happen no matter what you do they wont stop. also the bar for awearness can effect things that the player does or sees
